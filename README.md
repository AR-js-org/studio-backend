# AR.js Studio Backend

## Introduction

This project provides general functionality for the AR.js Studio Frontend, e.g. barcode/matrix code generation,
pattern image generation etc. It is a separate project in order to be able to maintain functionality that is
independent from the concrete frontend implementation.

## Developing

For maintaining a consistent code style while developing, please use Visual Studio Code with the Pretter plugin
installed.

To run the internal test suite, execute `npm run test`.
